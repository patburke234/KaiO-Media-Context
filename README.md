# KaiO-Media-Context
Context wrapper for interacting with the KaiOS File System APIs in React JS, Typescript. A much simpler version of gaia-mediadb. 

Added a create-react-app wrapper to demonstrate usage. 

To use yourself, simply implement your Remote Server to connect to your remote file storage. I used Firebase Storage, however it will work the same for any.
